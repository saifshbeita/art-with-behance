**A Creative Guide by Saif**

## 🧠 Why Use Behance for Code-Based Art?

Behance isn’t just for graphic designers. If your creativity involves both code and visuals — like:

- 🎨 AI-generated artwork
- 🧬 Generative designs (p5.js, Processing, Three.js)
- 🌐 Creative websites or web-based portfolios
- 🖼️ Interactive, code-driven installations

Behance can be your visual storytelling platform — perfect for showcasing the *art* behind the *tech*.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

- A free Behance account
- A coded art project (hosted on GitHub or deployed live)
- Screenshots or videos of your work
- A short, engaging write-up for your project story

  - The tools or languages used
  - Screenshots or video demos
  - A link to the live project

### 2. Capture Visuals

  - **🚀 Final Result**
  - **🌐 Links to GitHub & Live Demo**

### 4. Add a Description Like This:

> *This piece blends AI creativity and classic design. Using Python and DALL·E, I generated visual reinterpretations of historical artworks. I refined the results in Photoshop and styled the final layout using Figma. This project explores the intersection of tech, culture, and visual storytelling.*

### 5. Share & Tag Smartly

- Use tags like `#creativecode`, `#generativeart`, `#aiart`, `#frontenddevelopment`
